## Loading and preprocessing the data
unzip data to obtain csv file

```{r}
library("data.table")
library(ggplot2)

fileUrl <- "https://github.com/rdpeng/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/activity.zip"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile=paste0(getwd(), '/activity.zip'))
unzip('activity.zip', exdir = "data")

activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Calculating the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm = FALSE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)]
head(Total_Steps, 10)

```

Making a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.

```{r}
ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) +
    labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")

```

Calculating the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE), Median_Steps = median(steps, na.rm = TRUE))]

```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

Making a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}
IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval)] 
ggplot(IntervalDT, aes(x = interval , y = steps)) + geom_line(color="blue", size=1) + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps", x = "Interval", y = "Avg. Steps per day")

IntervalDT[steps == max(steps), .(max_interval = interval)]
```

## Imputing missing values

Calculating the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s

```{r}
activityDT[is.na(steps), .N ]
# alternative solution
nrow(activityDT[is.na(steps),])
```

Filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. using median of 5-minute interval, etc.

```{r}
activityDT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
```

Creating a new dataset with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
data.table::fwrite(x = activityDT, file = "data/tidyData.csv", quote = FALSE)
```

4. Making a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculating the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.
```{r}
Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 

Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps), Median_Steps = median(steps))]
ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) + geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) + labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Creating a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend.

```{r}
activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
activityDT[, date := as.POSIXct(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")]
activityDT[, 'Day of Week':=weekdays(x = date)]
activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekday"
activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Saturday|Sunday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekend"
activityDT[, `weekday or weekend` := as.factor(`weekday or weekend`)]
head(activityDT, 10)

activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekday"
activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Saturday|Sunday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekend"
activityDT[, `weekday or weekend` := as.factor(`weekday or weekend`)]
head(activityDT, 10)
```
